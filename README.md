# Discord-Bot
Wanted to take the common project of a tictactoe game one step further through the use of a Discord bot. I setup the bot through Discord and then added the custom command "/tictactoe" in order for the bot to interact and respond to me. Then setup the game board and made it interactive through button clicks with JavaScript. Then implemented the game logic which I have already done in a previous project but added it to the bot as well. After that, I setup an SQLite database in order to track users game stats (wins, losses, draws). Then used a template I found off Reddit to setup a website using React and NodeJS in order for someone to add the bot to their Discord server after going through the Discord authentication/permissions for bots page. 

Full scale Discord bot that lets you play an interactive custom game of tictactoe against it. The gameboard and bot was built using JavaScript. The bot also has persistent storage to track and display your stats after each game. The database was built and implemented using SQLite. You can also add the bot to your own server through a site I built with React and NodeJS.
