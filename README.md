Wanted to take the common project of a tictactoe game one step further through the use of a Discord bot. I setup the bot through Discord and then added the custom command "/tictactoe" in order for the bot to interact and respond to me. Then setup the game board and made it interactive through button clicks with JavaScript. Then implemented the game logic which I have already done in a previous project but added it to the bot as well. After that, I setup an SQLite database in order to track users game stats (wins, losses, draws). Then used a template I found off Reddit to setup a website using React and NodeJS in order for someone to add the bot to their Discord server after going through the Discord authentication/permissions for bots page.
